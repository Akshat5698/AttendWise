## 🎯 Subject Priority Engine

Each subject is classified into:

- 🚨 Critical – Immediate attendance required  
- ⚠️ Watch – Attend carefully  
- 😌 Safe – Bunkable  
- 🟢 Not Started – No classes conducted yet  

The engine considers:
- Current attendance percentage  
- Classes attended vs delivered  
- Weekly class frequency  
- Semester-aware recovery logic  
- Special teaching days  

---

## 📅 Semester Calendar Support

AttendWise supports non-standard teaching days, such as Saturdays that follow weekday timetables.

Calendar data is loaded from:
```
data/saturday_teaching_days.csv
```

These days are included when estimating recovery timelines.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- No direct ERP integration  
- Attendance files must follow the expected format  
- Forecasts assume consistent future attendance  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- PDF report export  
- ERP API integration  
- Mobile-optimized UI  
- Auto-import semester calendars  
- Multi-semester comparison
